Portfolio Website built using Next.js + React.js

This is a static version of my Portfolio Website: [https://alvinf.vercel.app/](https://alvinf.vercel.app/)

You'll find all relevant Demo Data in 'constants/defaultValues.js'.
For styling, I used Emotion: [https://emotion.sh](https://emotion.sh).
I made a simple theming kit to make it easier for you to customize the Interface.
You can edit the theme variable in 'constants/theme.js'.
Media Query breakpoints are defined in 'constants/mq.js'.
